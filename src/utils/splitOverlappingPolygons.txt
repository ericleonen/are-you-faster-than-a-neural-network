1. determine what type of shape is drawn
    - ALGO 1: convex or concave?
        - iterate over all points p_i and get p_(i + 1) and p_(i + 2)
        


    there are 3 possibilities
        1. convex
        2. concave
            - GOAL: turn into convex
        3. complex
            - GOAL: turn into simple shapes
